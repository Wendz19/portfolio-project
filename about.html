                    Front-end Developer, based in Johannesburg
                </h3>
                <p class="content-paragrapgh my-3">
                    I'm a front-end developer that has just over a year of experience. I've
                    been programming websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have a
                    passion for designing, which I'm currently trying to work on and improve
                    this year.
                    My love for programming started when I decided to enroll for an AWS course.
                    <br>
                    At first, I was overwhelmed and confused but
                    I took little steps to try understanding the content and
                    learnt to be patient with myself, and I completed it. I then started
                    being interesting in other things I could learn and do, and I came
                    across SheCodes. Women were talking about how easy it makes
                    learning how to code and how good the instructor actually was and I was sold,
                    so I enrolled and started my amazing journey.
                    My coding journey has had its ups and downs, its taught me so much about
                    myself. That I can do whatever I put my mind to, I can be disciplined
                    and consistent when it comes to hard work. The downs? Having to navigate
                    a world you have no idea about with no mentor is difficult, about the
                    many mistakes it comes with this sucks but worth it because I see them
                    as lessons than I do as mistakes.
