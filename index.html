                <p class="home-paragraph">
                    Johannesburg (colloquially known as Jozi, Joburg, or "The City of Gold") is the most populous city
                    in South
                    Africa with 4,803,262 people.
                    Johannesburg is a centre of mining, manufacturing, and finance. All the mining houses are
                    headquartered in the city, as
                    is the Chamber of Mines, which regulates the industry. Local factories in Johannesburg and on the
                    East Rand produce a
                    great variety of goods ranging from textiles to specialty steels.
                    With its vibrant economy and diverse cultural offerings, it's no surprise that people from all over
                    the world are moving
                    to Johannesburg for job opportunities, educational advancement and a chance to experience life in
                    one of the continent's
                    most dynamic cities.

                <p class="home-paragraph">
                    In South Africa, the terms "township" and "lokshin" - derived from the word location, usually refer
                    to the often
                    underdeveloped racially segregated urban areas.
                    Townships were created in the late 19th century but the peak of its “popularity” came in the
                    apartheid times, a dark
                    page in the South Africa history, when “non-white” people were forced to leave their houses and move
                    to special places,
                    designated only for certain race groups (black people, coloreds and Indians).
                    Many townships have a strong sense of community, with residents often supporting and looking out for
                    each other.
                    Living in a township can offer a unique opportunity to experience the diverse cultures and
                    traditions of South Africa.
